		h1 What is Experimonth?
		
		.row
			.span8
				p Experimonth started in January of 2009 as a way to redefine New Year's Resolutions. Its roots are of habit-making and self-awareness. In April of 2011, it was brought to the Museum of Life and Science as a way to co-create a fun experience with a local researcher, <a href="http://francesulmanphd.com/">Frances Ulman, Ph.D.</a>  The experiment went well and it's been an evolving model of public participation in scientific research ever since. While it's changed a lot in the last five years, Experimonth remains true to its origins as a way to know oneself better and try new things. The experimonths on this site are the result of a 3-year project called "The Science of Sharing: Exhibits and Activities Fostering Investigation of Cooperation, Competition and Social Interdependence" funded by the National Science Foundation. A collaboration between the Museum of Life and Science and the Exploratorium, Science of Sharing is designed to:

				ul
					li foster public experimentation with cooperation, resource allocation, and collaborative problem-solving;
					li promote awareness of connections between these experiences and current research in psychology and economics; and
					li generate public discussion of links between everyday social interactions and larger issues of resource depletion and group conflict, such as energy crises, arms races, ecosystem collapse, and climate change.
				
				p Experimonths generally start with a relationship between a museum and a local expert (scientists, artists, historians, etc.).  Together, an experience is crafted that challenges participants to do something every day for a month. The requirements for this challenge are generally: 
				
				ul
					li It must be interesting to do.
					li The participant can always modify the experience to suit his or her own needs.
					li The data generated must be interesting to the expert.
				
				p After an idea is conceived and the necessary technology implemented, the Experimonth is published on this website and enrollment is opened.  Some Experimonths can take an unlimited number of participants, others accept a limited number. This is clearly displayed on the <a href="/currently-recruiting">Currently Recruiting</a> page.
				
				p Depending on what Experimonth you choose to do, you'll be asked to answer a set of questions that the scientist we've worked with wants to know about each participant. You'll see these at the top of every page on the site until they're all answered.  You can always choose not to answer the questions, but you have to explicitly make that choice. You can also choose not to donate your data. This won't affect your ability to play the game. You can also always opt-out of data collection at any time, even if you've previously said it's okay to donate your data.
				
				p When the Experimonth you've signed up for begins, you'll be notified via email each day during the month in which it occurs.  When it's over, we'll generally send a wrap-up email co-written with the scientist sharing what we've learned.
				
				p Experimonths are always more fun with friends, <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=I just signed up to @experimonth because ">so invite them liberally</a>. Also, you can <a href="/get-notified">sign up to be notified</a> of new Experimonths in the case that you decide not to constantly monitor the <a href="/currently-recruiting">Currently Recruiting</a> page.
				
				p One last thing... we have a <a href="/confessional">Confessional</a> open for your anonymous thoughts. This started as a way to give people a chance to share their thoughts on an Experimonth we did in November 2011 on race and ethnicity, and it went so well, we've included it on every Experimonth since. Share what you have to say or read what others have said and respond. We explicitly drop all identifying information before recording the confession and its timestamp to our database, so it's one of the rare places on the Internet where you aren't tracked. Use as often as you like.

					p Elizabeth was the first person to experimonth with Beck, joining her and some of their colleagues, friends and strangers for each of the original 2009 experimonths. She has helped develop them from their first imaginings at the museum and specifically thinks up ways they can be explored in physical space.
